The structure of the page is up to you, but it must contain the following elements:

- a **header** with the page title and a background image;
- a **navigation menu**, arranged horizontally at the top or vertically at the side, containing links to other sections of the site (the pages to which the links refer do not need to exist);
- a **content section**, which represents the main body of the page. This section must in turn be divided into "blocks" of information (to be arranged as you wish using Flexbox), specific to your site project (e.g., if it is an online newspaper, each block can represent news; if it is a travel agency, each block can represent a flight or a reservation);
- a **footer** that contains information about the page (including name, surname, serial number).
